  This week's challenge was analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

Utilizing a Amazon review for the product tools dataset; Pyspark was used to perform the ETL process then connected to an AWS RDS and load the four seperate tables into pgAdmin.
